## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me refine my **flexbox layout skills** and improve my understanding of **media queries** for responsive design. Below is an example of a media query I used:

```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .card {
        max-width: 384px;
        height: 522px;
    }
    .illustration {
        width: 336px;
        height: 200px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on:

- **CSS Grid** for better layout structuring
- Enhancing **accessibility** and keyboard navigation
- Improving **hover states and animations**

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) - Helped me refine my media query logic.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me structure the layout efficiently.
